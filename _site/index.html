<p>I’d like to welcome you to my website. If you’re reading this, you likely have questions about a particular legal matter or you’re experiencing a legal issue and are seeking help. I’m practicing law precisely to help people just like you! Allow me to tell you a little about my background.</p>

<p>I grew up in the Cleveland area, but I’ve made my home in Cuyahoga Falls for more than 30 years. Before turning to law, I earned a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Kent State University and a bachelor’s in Elementary Education from the University of Akron.</p>

<p>Before going to law school, I gained extensive business experience working in the printing and graphics industry, I and also spent a number of years teaching in public and private schools. As rewarding as I found teaching, the law kept tugging at my heart.</p>

<p>I earned my Juris Doctorate from The University of Akron School of Law and was admitted to the Ohio Bar in 2013. During law school, I interned at the Summit County Juvenile Court and the Summit County Probate Court and clerked for various Akron attorneys in the areas of Estate Planning, Probate, and Child Custody.</p>

<p>Today I serve as a CASA/Guardian ad Litem and represent parents and children in Abuse/Neglect/Dependency cases and Legal Custody cases. I also enjoy assisting my clients in planning for the disposition of their assets or in settling a loved one’s estate.</p>

<p>I am a member of the Akron Bar Association and a member in good standing of the Ohio Supreme Court, and I have been admitted to practice in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Ohio.</p>

<p>If you would like to discuss your case, please call me for a confidential consultation at 330-920-1210.</p>
